        <p>Oprah Gail Winfrey (Orpah Gail Winfrey born January 29, 1954), often referred to mononymously as Oprah, is an American talk show host, television producer, actress, author, and philanthropist. She is best known for her talk show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, broadcast from Chicago, which ran in national syndication for 25 years, from 1986 to 2011.[better source needed] Dubbed the "Queen of All Media", she was the richest African-American of the 20th century and was once the world's only black billionaire. By 2007, she was sometimes ranked as the most influential woman in the world.

          Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a single teenage mother and later raised in inner-city Milwaukee. She has stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teenage years and became pregnant at 14; her son was born prematurely and died in infancy. Winfrey was then sent to live with the man she calls her father, Vernon Winfrey, a barber in Nashville, Tennessee, and landed a job in radio while still in high school. By 19, she was a co-anchor for the local evening news. Winfrey's often emotional, extemporaneous delivery eventually led to her transfer to the daytime talk show arena, and after boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place, she launched her own production company.</p>

        <p>Angela Dorothea Merkel ( Kasner born 17 July 1954) is a German former politician and scientist who served as Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021. A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), she previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union from 2000 to 2018. Merkel was the first female chancellor of Germany. During her tenure as Chancellor, Merkel was frequently referred to as the de facto leader of the European Union (EU), the most powerful woman in the world, and since 2016 the leader of the free world.
          As voted by Forbes magazine in 2006, Angela Merkel took the place of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to top the list of the 100 Most Powerful Women in the world, and repeatedly held the position for the next thirteen years. In 2014, Merkel was the longest serving head of State in the European Union. In 2015, she was named Person of the year by Time magazine due to her leadership role in the public debt crisis, the European immigration crisis as well as the crisis in Ukraine. In October 2018, she announced she would step down as chairman of the CDU party and would not run for a fifth term in the 2021 federal election.

        <p>The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly. Described as an international bill of rights for women, it was instituted on 3 September 1981 and has been ratified by 189 states. Over fifty countries that have ratified the Convention have done so subject to certain declarations, reservations, and objections, including 38 countries who rejected the enforcement article 29, which addresses means of settlement for disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the convention. Australia's declaration noted the limitations on central government power resulting from its federal constitutional system. The United States and Palau have signed, but not ratified the treaty. The Holy See, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, and Tonga are not signatories to CEDAW.
          The CEDAW Chairperson position is currently held by Hilary Gbedemah.</p>

            After thousands of years of subjugation and subordination under the male identity, women across the world are breaking the stereotypes and resetting the social equations to seek equal rights and responsibilities. The world is passing through an evolutionary transition phase of amazing transformation when women are coming forward to lead from the front, which was the monopoly of men just a few decades ago. This silent revolution, with empowerment and participation at the core, is changing the dynamics of socio-economic, demographic, behavioral and of course the financial equations.

    <p> Since ancient times, women have always been an important and large force in the team of workers who make up society. Women play an important role in all areas of social life. It can be said that, in modern life a woman has a huge role. If the family is considered a cell of society,then the woman is considered the nucleus of this cell. The family is a place that essentially demonstrates equality and enhances the status of a woman. Besides, the woman of modern times is even more inseparable from family and social realities. Women of any age, nation play an important role in creating and preserving the traditional cultural values of each nation.</p>
